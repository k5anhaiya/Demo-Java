How to call method

1)Command to create variable

Variable
--------

Task related to data.
Data is kept into memory by the perogram/computer before processing as well as after processing
Program must reserve space in memory to keep data.
Space resrerved by program into memory is known as variable.We can also say variable is container of data
It is a named space.
We need to write command to reserve space in memory.This command is also known as command to create variable or variab le declaration

Syntax:

datatype variable_name;

Datatypes will be provided by programming language.
In java we can divide datatypes into following two categories

1)Primitive datatypes:These datatypes are also known as fundamental datatypes.
In java there are 8 primitive datatypes

Datatypes		Value/Data type		Size in bit
---------		----------		-----------
byte			Integer			8
short			Integer			16
int			Integer			32
long			Integer			64
float			Fractional		32			
double			Fractional		64
boolean			true/false		1
char			single character	16
---------------------------------------------------

byte v1;
short v2;
int v3;
long v4;
float v5;
double v6;
boolean v7;
char v8;



2)Non-primitive datatypes: These data types are also called derivied data types. String is one of the dervied data types.
These data types are derived from other data types.
