Program is set of methods
Method is set of commands/instructions


These commands are executed by computer
We need to write these commands
Commands could be as follows

1)Command to create variables
2)Command to assign value to the variables
3)Command to perform arithmetical and comparison and logical operation
4)Command to apply condition
5)Command to execute loop
6)Command to create objects
7)Command to create array
8)Command to call methods
etc

These are basic building blocks of program
These commands should be written inside method/methods

Defining methods
----------------
1)Define prototype of method
2)Define body/implementation of method

public static void add()
{
  Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter first number:");
  int num1=sc.nextInt();
  System.out.print("Enter second number:");
  int num2=sc.nextInt();
  int res=num1+num2;	
  System.out.println("Sum="+sum);	
} 


Prototype of method
-------------------
It consists of
1)[Parameter list/argument list]
2)Name
3)Return type
4)[Modifiers]


Running/executing method commands
---------------------------------
Commands inside methods arec executed when method is called.
We need to write command to call methods

aa.methodname();
or
methodname();

This code should be written inside another method

JVM
---
One method of your program will be called by JVM.
This is program which we have already insalled.
Name of this method should be main()
This main() will be called by JVM
Prototype of main method should be as follows

public static void main(String [] args) 

main() method
-------------
Every java program must have main() method.Without main() method java program can not run.
