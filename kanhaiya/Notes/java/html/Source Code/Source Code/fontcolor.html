        Archaeoindris fontoynontii is a gorilla-sized extinct giant lemur,
         the largest primate known from Madagascar. This sloth lemur was related 
         to the extinct Palaeopropithecus and became extinct around 350 BCE. It was
          first described by Herbert F. Standing in 1909 based on subfossil jaw
           fragments, although a complete skull was later found. Only six bones from
            the lower skeleton have been located. The skeleton was massive and the
             arms were longer than the legs, but no hand or foot bones are known. 
             Size estimates range as high as 244.1 kilograms (538.1 pounds), 
             but regression analyses predict a mass of 160 kg (350 lb).
              Misattributions and limited remains have resulted in differing opinions
               about how this lemur moved. Its skeleton suggests it was a climber
                that also travelled on the ground. Its diet was mostly leaves, and
                 its former habitat, a mix of woodlands and savanna, is now mainly
                  grassland. When humans arrived on Madagascar, it was still extant
                   but vulnerable to hunting and habitat loss. (Full article...)
