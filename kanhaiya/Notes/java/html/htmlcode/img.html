    <strong>Katrina Kaif (pronounced [kəˈʈriːna kɛːf]; born Katrina Turquotte; 16 July 1983[a]) is a British actress who
        works in Hindi-language films. One of the highest-paid actresses in India, she has received several accolades,
        including four Screen Awards and four Zee Cine Awards, in addition to three Filmfare nominations. She is noted
        for her dancing ability in various successful item numbers.

        Born in Hong Kong, Kaif lived in several countries before she moved to London for three years. She received her
        first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in
        London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While Kaif
        established a successful modelling career in India, she initially had difficulty finding film roles due to her
        poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in
        Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). Further success
        followed with a series of box-office hits, but she was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and
        inclination to male-dominated films.

        Kaif's performances in the thriller New York (2009) and the romantic comedy Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011) were
        better received, earning her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She starred in Ajab Prem Ki
        Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) during this period, and found major
        commercial success in the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), all of
        which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. These were followed by a series of commercial failures,
        though the action films Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and Sooryavanshi (2021) and the drama Bharat (2019) were
        box-office hits. Kaif's portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018) earned her a Zee
        Cine Award for Best Supporting Actress.

    <code>Katrina Kaif was born in British Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983.[5][6][7] Her father, Mohammed Kaif, is a British businessman of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker.[8][9] She has seven siblings: three elder sisters named Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha; three younger sisters named Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel; and an elder brother named Sebastien.[10] Isabel is also a model and actress.[11] Kaif's parents divorced when she was a child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on her or her siblings while they were growing up, and that they were raised by their mother.[5][9][12] In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.[9]

        In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. We thought we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience ... But then we thought that Kazi sounded too ... religious? ... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great".[8] Kaif denied this, calling Shroff's comments "hurtful".[5]

        As Kaif's mother is a social activist, the family relocated to a number of countries for varying lengths of time.[12] Therefore, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled by a series of tutors.[13] She said:</code>

    <b>At a fashion show Kaif attracted the attention of London-based filmmaker Kaizad Gustad. She made her acting debut
        in Gustad's Hindi-English heist film Boom starring Amitabh Bachchan, Gulshan Grover, Jackie Shroff, Madhu Sapre
        and Padma Lakshmi.[16][17] While filming in India, Kaif received other offers and decided to stay in the
        country; she then changed her surname to her father's because she thought it would be easier to
        pronounce.[18][19] She was noticed as a model after walking the ramp for Rohit Bal at the India Fashion Week[20]
        and appeared in the first Kingfisher Calendar.[21] After endorsing such brands as Coca-Cola, LG, Fevicol and
        Samsung, Kaif soon established a successful modelling career in India.[22]

        Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was heavily promoted,[23][24] but
        emerged as a commercial and critical failure.[25][26] Kaif's portrayal of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai
        underworld was poorly received; Ziya Us Salam of The Hindu wrote of the weak performances by Kaif and the other
        female stars, criticising their inexpressiveness.[27] She later dismissed Boom as an unimportant part of her
        career, ascribing her choice to her unawareness of Indian audiences' film taste then.[28] Hindustan Times
        reported that after Boom's release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent;[29] as
        a result, filmmakers were hesitant in casting her in their films.[30] Kaif soon began working on her diction
        through Hindi classes.[28] In 2003, director Mahesh Bhatt replaced Kaif with Tara Sharma in Saaya as he found
        Kaif's acting on set subpar compared to her audition for the role.[31]

        After the failure of her first Bollywood project, Kaif appeared in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), in which
        she played the title role of a princess forced to flee from her murderous caretaker. Kaif received a reported
        salary of ₹7.5 million (US$100,000) for the film, the highest for a female lead at the time in South Indian
        cinema; Sify attributed this achievement to her looks and figure.[32] Despite negative reviews for her acting,
        she was nominated for a Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and received several film offers
        afterwards.[33][32] Malliswari was a profitable venture.[34] In 2005, Kaif appeared briefly as Abhishek
        Bachchan's girlfriend in Ram Gopal Varma's political thriller Sarkar.[35] She next featured alongside Salman
        Khan, Sushmita Sen and Sohail Khan in Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?, a film she considered her "first real step into
        Bollywood".[36] Directed by David Dhawan, the film was a successful remake of the romantic comedy Cactus
        Flower.[37][38] For her role as a suicidal model, Kaif received the Stardust Award for Breakthrough Performance
        – Female.[39] According to Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com, "Katrina's Disney princess-like charm adds to her
        adorable screen presence".[40] Kaif followed with her second Telugu film, Allari Pidugu, in which she had "very
        little role to play and shake a leg or two with the hero", according to a critic from The Hindu.[41]</b>
