    <p>Patrick Francis Healy (February 27, 1834 – January 10, 1910) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit. While
        Healy was one-sixteenth black and considered himself to be white, he was posthumously recognized as the first
        black American to become a Jesuit, to earn a PhD, and to become the president of a predominantly white
        university. Born in Georgia, Healy was legally considered a slave by birth and was sent north by his father to
        be educated alongside his brothers. After studying in Massachusetts, Healy entered the Society of Jesus and
        eventually earned his doctorate in Belgium. Healy was named the chair of philosophy at Georgetown University in
        1866 and became its president in 1873. He aimed to transform the institution into a modern university by
        expanding courses in the sciences, raising standards at the medical school, and growing the law school. He also
        had constructed the university's flagship building, Healy Hall. For this, he became known as Georgetown's
        "second founder".</p>

    <p>A nuclear weapon (also known as an atom bomb, atomic bomb, nuclear bomb or nuclear warhead, and colloquially as
        an A-bomb or nuke) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either
        fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types
        release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter.

        The first test of a fission ("atomic") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of
        TNT (84 TJ).[1] The first thermonuclear ("hydrogen") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million
        tons of TNT (42 PJ). Nuclear bombs have had yields between 10 tons TNT (the W54) and 50 megatons for the Tsar
        Bomba (see TNT equivalent). A thermonuclear weapon weighing as little as 600 pounds (270 kg) can release energy
        equal to more than 1.2 megatonnes of TNT (5.0 PJ).[2]

        A nuclear device no larger than a conventional bomb can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation.
        Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international
        relations policy. Nuclear weapons have been deployed twice in war, by the United States against the Japanese
        cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 during World War II.</p>

    <p>Nuclear weapons have only twice been used in war, both times by the United States against Japan near the end of
        World War II. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed
        "Little Boy" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on August 9, the U.S. Army Air Forces
        detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These
        bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military
        personnel.[3] The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are subjects of debate.

        Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been detonated over 2,000 times for
        testing and demonstration. Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them. The only
        countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and acknowledge possessing them—are (chronologically by date
        of first test) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom,
        France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though, in a
        policy of deliberate ambiguity, it does not acknowledge having them. Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium and the
        Netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states.[4][5][6] South Africa is the only country to have independently
        developed and then renounced and dismantled its nuclear weapons.[7]

        The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, but its
        effectiveness has been questioned. Modernisation of weapons continues to this day.[8]
