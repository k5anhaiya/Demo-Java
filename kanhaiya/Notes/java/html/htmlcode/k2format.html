    <p>Nuclear weapons have only twice been used in war, both times by the United States against Japan near the end of
        World War II. On August 6, 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed
        "Little Boy" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on August 9, the U.S. Army Air Forces
        detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed "Fat Man" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These
        bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military
        personnel.[3] The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are subjects of debate.

        Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been detonated over 2,000 times for
        testing and demonstration. Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them. The only
        countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and acknowledge possessing them—are (chronologically by date
        of first test) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom,
        France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though, in a
        policy of deliberate ambiguity, it does not acknowledge having them. Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium and the
        Netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states.[4][5][6] South Africa is the only country to have independently
        developed and then renounced and dismantled its nuclear weapons.[7]

        The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, but its
        effectiveness has been questioned. Modernisation of weapons continues to this day.[8]
